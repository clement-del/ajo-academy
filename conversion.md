Personalize the Conversion Path and Abandoned Cart Follow-Up
============================================================================

We will now personalize the conversion path using AEP's customer experience engine, Journey Optimizer. 

The objective of our customer journey is twofold:

- Retarget Luma website users who have abandoned the purchase process.
- Send a confirmation message to users who have confirmed their orders.

## The Journey Optimizer User Interface

Click on the 9 dots in the top right corner of the interface and on the _Journey Optimizer_ link in the drop-down menu.

You are now in the AEP orchestration engine. You can access the journey directly from the home page or by clicking on the Journey link in the left menu.

## The Journey Canvas
The customer journey canvas is the central point for creating a real-time customer experience. The interface allows you to drag and drop three types of activities:
- Events: These are user actions (or actions generated by a third-party system) that arrive in real time in the platform, and on which you want to interact.
- Orchestration activities: Useful for filtering and timing customers entering your journey.
- Actions: Necessary for communicating with your customers and your business ecosystem.

The journey has been predefined for this lab. The inbound event is automatically activated when a Luma website user clicks the _Proceed_ button. This event contains a set of data such as cart contents and customer IDs.
A second event, called _LumaPurchaseEvent_, is triggered when the customer completes the purchase. When it is activated, we invoke Adobe Campaign via the _OrderConfirmation_ action to send the order summary by email.

We can also take advantage of the non-receipt of an event to retarget our contacts who have entered the journey with appropriate communication. Indeed, the lower path of the _LumaPurchaseEvent_ event will automatically trigger after a given period of inactivity (set to 10 seconds for this lab), allowing us to route our customers to an alternative path.

## The Abandoned Cart Email

To re-engage our customers who haven't completed the purchasing process, we'll use an action activity. This will allow us to instantly communicate with Adobe Campaign's transactional component to send a message inviting the customer to return to the website.

- Select the _CampaignCartAbandonment_ activity from the Activities menu
- Drag and drop it into the bottom path of the customer journey so that it is linked to the previous event
- In the _Email_ field, click the pencil icon and select _LumaCheckoutEvent -> demosystem4 -> identification -> core -> Email_ and click _OK_
- In the _Name_ field, click the pencil icon and type _first_ to filter the attributes and select the first attribute _firstName_ and click _OK_
- Link the _LumaPurchaseEvent1_ event to the activity transition _CampaignCartAbandonment_

## Test your journey
Now it's time to test your journey!
- In the canvas, activate _test mode_, return to the website, add an item to your cart, and click the _Shopping Cart_ button in the top right corner of the interface. Click the _Checkout_ button, then _Proceed_.
- Return to Profile Orchestration and view your user's progress through the customer journey. After a given period of inactivity, the user is considered to have abandoned the purchase process, and the email you previously configured is sent with a link to revalidate their cart.
- Go to your email client and click on the link in the new email received. This will take you back to the cart, where you can complete your purchase online.
