In this chapter of the lab, we are going to explore single action campaigns. Journey Optimizer campaigns delivers one-time content to a specific audience as opposed to journeys where actions are executed in sequence. The delivery of the campaign can be performed immediately, based on a specified schedule or triggered through an API call. 

As a Luma marketers, we'd like to build a Campaign to promote the new Luma Fall Collection. This campaign will display a banner on the website to invite visitors to look at the Fall Collection landing page. To build a campaign, we'd need first to determine the target audience, then the web content to display. We'd like to create 2 variants of our content and test out which one works best to then communicate the most effective experimentation to our audience.

## Create a Content Card
Adobe Content Cards help Luma effectively showcase the Fall'25 Collection in a way that is personalized, visually appealing, and user-friendly, leading to higher engagement and increased sales. Unlike traditional push notifications, Content cards integrate seamlessly into the user interface, offering persistent, non-intrusive updates that enhance user interaction and experience.

## Create an Experimentation
Experiments allow you to optimize content for the action in your Campaigns. They are a set of randomized trials, which in the context of online testing, means that some randomly selected users are exposed to a given variation of a message and another randomly selected set of users to another treatment. After sending the message, you can then measure the outcome metrics like opens of emails or clicks on banner.

- Click ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/475e2ef5-963c-4c48-af94-1a11dd846115) button.
- Use Unique Clicks as success metrics.
- Use a 10% Holdout group
- Create a second treatment, A and B distributed evently
- Click _Create_ button
