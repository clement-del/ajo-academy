Acquiring New Customer Data
==========================================

First, let's open a new tab in an **incognito mode (sometimes called private browsing)** browser session, copy the Luma demo website address:
<a href="https://dsn.adobe.com/web/ajo-academy/" target="_blank">https://dsn.adobe.com/web/ajo-academy/</a>

This the Luma website powered by Adobe web SDK to collect in real time customer behaviors. Before that, you need to give your consent by clicking the **Allow All** button displayed in the cookie notice banner

If you have visited three product pages in the same category (men or women), you are automatically qualified for the corresponding segment.
