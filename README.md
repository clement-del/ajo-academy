# AJO Academy Lab - Drive all your customer experiences with real-time journeys and batch campaigns

Adobe Journey Optimizer (AJO) lets you orchestrate and deliver personalised customer engagement across all channels — including email, web, app, mobile and in-person — in the moments that matter to the customer.
AJO is an app built on top of Adobe Experience Platform (AEP), it leverages Adobe Real Time Customer Profile to power digital experiences.  With AEP and AJO,  you'll then be able to : 
- Collect data in real time through Adobe Experience SDKs and APIs and articulate those touchpoints altogether to build powerful customer journeys.
- Decide which customer behaviors should be heard  and react accordingly and determine the best route for your contacts.
- Build complex customer journeys with a graphical orchestrator and deliver  personalized, just in time messages
- Create campaigns to deliver personalized communications across your own inbound and outbound channels and ensure a true consistent experience to your customers.

---

During this lab, we will use a fictitious sports equipment brand - called **Luma** - to illustrate these these aspects through a customer journey composed of 3 chapters:

- **Acquisition of new customer data** from the Luma website. Thanks to real-time collection, we will collect visitor interactions, even anonymous ones, and personalize the website in real time based on their browsing behavior. When a user creates their account, their behavior as an anonymous visitor will be automatically linked to their known profile and will complete the 360° view in Adobe Experience Platform.

- **Conversion and cart abandonment**. By using the orchestration engine, we will be define personalized messages at each stage of the online payment process. From adding a product to a cart to finalizing the payment, we can interact through personalized communications with our future customers, and also retarget them if they do not complete the purchase process.

- **Cross-selling**. Let's use the artificial intelligence capabilities of the Adobe Experience Platform to calculate an audience that will be most likely to buy an outdoor sports accessory in the next 3 weeks based on the analysis of behavioral data from our previous customers. Let's then share this audience with Snapchat and Adobe Campaign and refine our targeting (pressure rules, deliverability management, etc.)

## Exercices
We prepared a few exercices to help you grasp all the benefits AJO offers when bringing a customer journey to life.

In those exercices, you'll be int the marketeer shoes and you goal will be to prepare campaign for Luma, our fictitious sport apparel brand. The lab is composed of 3 chapters : 

[Acquisition](./acquisition.md): Navigate the demo website and generate data to then visualize it in Adobe Experience Platform.

[Conversion](./conversion.md): Configure the purchasing journey and its different stages, from checkout to payment, including retargeting abandonners.

[Batch Campaign](./campaign.md): Create an batch campaign to target your visitors on the website, based on their browsing interest and display a banner on the home page of Luma website to promote the fall outdoor gear  collection. We'll use advanced marketing techniques to experiment what content works best and apply presure rules to ensure we're not oversoliicitating our customers with too many messages.
